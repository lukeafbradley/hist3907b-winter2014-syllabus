This is a basic jekyll structure. Take a look at the layout in `_layouts/layout.html` and the navigation snippet in `_includes/_navigation.html`.

Page urls are defined using the `permalink` frontmatter, so you can call the files whatever you like. I would recommend numbering the pages to control their order in the navigation:

    01-index.md
    02-about.md
    03-another.md
    ...

I'll probably add to this as I come up with cool things to do with Jekyll.
